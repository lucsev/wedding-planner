                                 <h4 align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top:10px;\">Flights</h4>\
                                 <p align=\"left\">The closest airport is Seville (SVQ). There are regular non-stop flights from Stansted (Ryanair), Luton (Ryanair) and Gatwick (BA/Iberia, EasyJet, Vueling). In <a href=\"https://www.google.com/travel/flights\">Google Flights</a> you can browse or book your flights.</p> \
                                 <h4 align=\"left\" style=\"padding-top:10px;\">Venue Directions</h4>\
                                 <p align=\"left\">The venue will be <a href=\"https://www.villaluisa.com/en\">Villa Luisa</a>, located at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/Svwe3juagYinef7f9\">\"Avenida Manuel Siurot, 1\"</a>. You can get there: \
                                 <br/> <span>&#8226;</span> On foot: It takes around 30 minutes if you are staying near the Cathedral and you don't stop for pictures. It's a very nice walk along the city, the Plaza de España and the Parque de Maria Luisa, but don't be late! \
                                 <br/> <span>&#8226;</span> By Taxi: There is a taxi rank next to the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/4C1xuXBqvYmbxac37\">Cathedral</a>, and another next to the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/92EYsPtYXFvyz6VY8\">Puerta de Jerez</a>. If you are staying in the city centre, those are probably the closest to you. If you give the driver the address (Avenida Manuel Siurot, 1), they'll know where it is. They take Euros or credit/debit card payments. A trip from the city centre should be around €6-8 and take 8 minutes. \
